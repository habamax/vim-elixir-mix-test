Simple plugin to run `mix test` for your elixir projects.

// add gif

== Why not?
There is `vim-test` -- very capable plugin to run tests for multiple dev
environments including elixir and its mix test, why this planet needs
`elixir_mix_test` plugin?

I couldn't make `vim-test` run elixir tests for me... That is a good reason to
invent a new plugin, because why not? :)

It should be fairly simple, have minimun configuration and just work out of the box.

And I mean -- just run mix test and show test results in a separate buffer.

== Mappings

There are no default mappings defined for elixir buffers.
But there is `<Plug>(MixTestRun)` you can map to run all your mix tests.

For example, add following mapping to `~/.vim/after/elixir.vim` file (create
if needed) to define a mapping only for elixir buffers:

	nmap <buffer> <leader>tt <Plug>(MixTestRun)

Once you run mix tests there should be new window opened with the name like:

	'elixir_project_folder_name' -- mix test output

If your elixir project folder is `Hello world`, the window name should be:

	Hello world -- mix test output


This window has following mappings:

`<C-n>`	- goto next test

`<C-p>`	- goto previous test

`<CR>`	- open file under cursor and jump to the line (the same as `gF`)

`q`		- close mix test output window

== Commands

`:MixTestRun`

Run mix test for the elixir project and show test results in a split window.

Elixir project is defined by a nearest to the current buffer upwards location
of the `mix.exs` file.

For example, if you are editing `advent/day5/lib/day5.ex` file 

	advent/
	│ day1/
	│ day2/
	│ day3/
	│ day4/
	│ day5/
	│ │ _build/
	│ │ config/
	│ │ lib/
	│ │ │ day5.ex
	│ │ test/
	│ │ │ day5_test.exs
	│ │ │ test_helper.exs
	│ │ .formatter.exs
	│ │ .gitignore
	│ │ README.md
	│ │ mix.exs

Then elixir project would be `day5`.
