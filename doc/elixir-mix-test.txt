================================================================================

There is 'vim-test' -- very capable plugin to run tests for multiple dev
environments including elixir and its mix test, why this planet needs
'elixir_mix_test' plugin?

I couldn't make vim-test run elixir tests for me... That is a good reason to
invent a new plugin, because why not?

It should have minimun configuration and just work out of the box:

	just run mix test and show test results in a separate buffer.


MAPPINGS                                            *elixir_mix_test-mappings*

There are no default mappings defined for elixir buffers.
But there is '<Plug>(MixTestRun)' you can map to run all your mix tests.

For example, add following mapping to '~/.vim/after/elixir.vim' file (create
if needed) to define a mapping only for elixir buffers:

	nmap <buffer> <leader>tt <Plug>(MixTestRun)

Once you run mix tests there should be new window opened with the name like:

	'elixir_project_folder_name' -- mix test output

If your elixir project folder is 'Hello world', the window name should be:

	Hello world -- mix test output


This window has following mappings:

<C-n>	- goto next test

<C-p>	- goto previous test

<CR>	- open file under cursor and jump to the line (the same as `gF`)

q		- close mix test output window


COMMANDS                                            *elixir_mix_test-commands*

:MixTestRun                                      *elixir_mix_test-:MixTestRun*

Run mix test for the elixir project and show test results in a split window.

Elixir project is defined by a nearest to the current buffer upwards location
of the 'mix.exs' file.

For example, if you are editing 'advent/day5/lib/day5.ex' file 

	advent/
	│ day1/
	│ day2/
	│ day3/
	│ day4/
	│ day5/
	│ │ _build/
	│ │ config/
	│ │ lib/
	│ │ │ day5.ex
	│ │ test/
	│ │ │ day5_test.exs
	│ │ │ test_helper.exs
	│ │ .formatter.exs
	│ │ .gitignore
	│ │ README.md
	│ │ mix.exs

Then elixir project would be 'day5'.
